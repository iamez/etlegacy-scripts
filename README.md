The freshinstall.sh script is designed for use on a freshly installed Linux server. The script automates the installation of the et:legacy game server for multiplayer gaming, and it installs all of the necessary dependencies and packages to get the server up and running. Additionally, the script creates a background script that ensures the et:legacy server runs smoothly and without issue.

It is important to note that the freshinstall.sh script should only be run once, as it is intended to automate the initial setup of the et:legacy server. Once the server is set up, the background script will continue to run and maintain the server's operation, and the user can forget about the initial installation process. Overall, the freshinstall.sh script is a useful tool for quickly and easily setting up an et:legacy game server on a Linux machine, and ensuring it runs smoothly over time.
